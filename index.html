<h1> NYPL branches grow more essential during pandemic for vulnerable communities. </h1>

<p> Libraries are seen as a public health hub for the community according to the District Statement of Needs assembled by Community Board 3 for the fiscal year of 2022. By offering webinars, adult education classes and book clubs that appeal to the older populations of residents in the area, libraries also provide a great service to seniors. </p>

<p> And yet, New York City’s Independent Budget Office reported in their preliminary budget for 2021 and beyond that New York Public Library branches might be seeing a decrease in funding. Some funds might be allocated for branches, but as it stands the budget for cultural assets in the city will be seeing a decrease from 2019. </p>

<p> This planned defunding comes as the District Statement of Needs by Community District 3 in Manhattan states that their branches saw <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/mancb3/downloads/cb3docs/CD3-DistrictNeedsStatement-FY2023.pdf"> some of the highest attendance in the city as well as high attendance for programming at those branches. </a> </p>

<p> When considering the types of residents who would need to utilize libraries and their resources (seniors without broadband, children who have missed school due to shutdowns), these numbers should not come as a huge shock. </p>

<p> Local resident Jan Lee emphasized this point and says that even those who have internet access still come to these library branches just for something to do outside after a year of not being able to something so simple. </p>

<p> “As we think of a low income community…they may not have a cellphone, they may not have broadband in their house. But a library has the ability to get anyone online,” says Lee, a lifelong Chinatown community member and participant in the Chinatown CORE block association. </p>

<p> The New York Public Library independently set up numerous programs during the pandemic to make sure their assistance could be delivered safely for older residents still looking for their help and social activities. </p>

<p> “During the pandemic, the library did have to revert to offering resources and services virtually, but we found opportunities to resume some of our in-person activities by hosting them online,” said Amy Geguldig, who is a spokesperson for the New York Public Library. </p>


<p> The attendance numbers reported for this district are in direct opposition to the budgeting plans from the Cultural Affairs department of New York City. The department, along with the City Council and Independent Budget Office, project these decreases as New York City attempts to financially recover from Covid-related shutdowns. </p>

<p> A cut back on hours, days of operation and staffing could deeply impact communities that are most vulnerable and in need of the services offered at their local branch, including seniors who have used libraries for socialization and education for years and became especially reliant on the library during the pandemic. </p>

<p> Alice Du, a spokesperson from the Department for the Aging, said that the pandemic revealed how important it was for vulnerable residents, but especially seniors, to have access to free Wi-Fi and programming offered by the NYPL. </p>

<p> “Staying connected and having access to virtual services are essential to combat social isolation and it is important to provide older adults with Wi-Fi service and technological equipment,” said Du. </p>

<p> Du said the city wanted to make sure seniors had options for assistance while still being socially distanced. This included the NYC Well phone, text and chat services provided during the shutdowns of last year as well as using volunteers to call seniors every day to keep them company safely. </p>

<p> These types of programs are not possible, however, without assistance from hubs like a local NYPL branch where internet access and virtual chatting is available for free and with help from branch volunteers and workers. </p>

<p> Negotiations are ongoing regarding this proposed budget cut between NYPL representatives and the City Council. </p>
